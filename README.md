# Pycalc

Pycalc is a simple open source cmd calculator written in Python. It has all basic operations(addition, subtraction, division, whole division, taking the remainder of the devision, multiplication and exponentation) and can work with any quantity of numbers. Only integers are supported for now, floats aren't.

## Setup
It's easy. Just run the setup.bat(if you're on Windows) or setup.sh(if you're on Linux or any other platform supporting bash).

For Windows you will need to run that as an administrator. But you must do it through the cmd and being in the project root. This is very important. Otherwise nothing will work rigt. And also you might need to reload your computer for that changes could take power.

    pycalc

in your shell. Aaaand... that's it! These are all the steps you need to do to fully install and setup pycalc on your computer. Wish you happy using!
